# L2DTE2024
Code for L2 DTE Website Project
README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.

When moving into bigger projects, you may wish to add:

Intro about the user and their career orientation
Possibly some programming languages they know or use
Then you can find a bunch of “add-ons” or “feeds” of some sorts
You can connect your GitHub README with Spotify, your blog, or almost anything that has an RSS feed and then show it on the README
You can show your GitHub stats - PRs merged, commits pushed, your GitHub contributions, contribution streaks etc.
Some of them even have GIFs, images, and so on.
